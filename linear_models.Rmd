LIbraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

```

Look at the data / do some cleaning

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group,
    ) |> 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |> 
  select(price, stars, borough, neighbourhood, room_type)
```

Do regression

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Do some additional cleaning then refit

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    borough = fct_infreq(borough), # order based on frequency
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )

fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Look at `lm` stuff

```{r}
summary(fit)
```
